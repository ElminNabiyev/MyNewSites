            Polat Alemdar is the biological son of Mehmet Karahanlı and Nergiz Karahanlı. Mehmet Karahanlı was an
            intelligence officer who provided many services to the state. He had carried out many successful operations,
            especially with Aslan Akbey. However, Karahanli, who was blinded by money and power in his last duties; He
            betrayed Israel by reporting that weapons were hidden in a refugee camp for Palestinians. Thereupon, the
            Israeli camp was bombed. Aslan Akbey's brother and his brother's fiancee, who were in the camp at the time,
            died. To take revenge, Aslan Bey, also known as Uncle, kidnapped Karahanlı's son, Efe Yakup Karahanlı, and
            gave him to the Child Protection Agency. When he sneezes like his father Mehmet Karahanlı, he sneezes 3
            times in a row. Only Aslan Akbey knows this secret. A couple named Ömer Candan and Nazife Candan wanted to
            adopt a child from the Child Protection Agency. The uncle arranged for Efe Yakup to be given up for adoption
            to this couple. Uncle's purpose; It was to prevent Efe Yakup from being found by his real mother and father
            again by hiding in an unknown family. Ömer and Nazife Candan couple named Efe Yakup Ali. Thus, Mehmet
            Karahanlı's son, Efe Yakup Karahanlı, became Ali Candan. When Ali Candan grew up, he graduated from Ankara
            University Faculty of Political Sciences and became a diplomat. Although Ali Candan looked like a diplomat,
            he was an intelligence officer and served Aslan Akbey. Ali Candan has performed successful operations in
            many European countries. He used the code name Hikmet in many foreign operations.

            He is of Laz origin.When he was 7 years old, he saw his father shot in front of him in the mosque courtyard,
            and because of this incident, he had a phobia of mosques. After his father died, he tried to support both
            his sister Derya and his mother Emine Çakır by selling the rice and chickpeas his mother made at home. One
            day, the police came and beat both him and his sister for selling in a forbidden place. He became furious
            after the police officer hit his sister during the harassment, and he stabbed the police officer repeatedly
            and killed him. He was later convicted of murder and imprisoned. When he was imprisoned, his mother and
            sister were left out in the open. For this reason, he was asked to stab Duran Şatıroğlu, aka Duran Emmi. He
            agreed to this because his mother and sister were in a bad situation. Duran Emmi went to kill him with a
            knife in his hand while he was ablution, but he couldn't do it when he saw his father dying while he was
            performing ablution. Duran Emmi became his mentor after this incident and took care of his family. Thanks to
            him, Derya was able to study architecture. He joined the mafia through Duran Emmi and started smuggling
            cigarettes. Then he married Laz Ziya's daughter Nesrin Yılmaz and made a name for himself in Kabadayı.

            He is a civil servant and intelligence officer who served for years in the east and southeast under the
            Gendarmerie Intelligence.He joined the Gendarmerie Intelligence and Counter-Terrorism unit, which was
            established by a gendarmerie colonel in the southeast, with the will of the state but unofficially, to fight
            the separatist terrorist organization by waging a guerrilla war, among names such as İskender Büyük. They
            thought that a radical Islamist group that emerged among the Sunni segment in the southeast could be useful.
            They contributed to the establishment of the Hizbullah (Domuzbağcılar)organization by helping them arm
            themselves and grow. They enabled Hezbollah (Domuzbağcılar) to engage in significant conflicts with the
            separatist terrorist organization. He served in the fight against Asala unit for a while. Ersoy Ulubey is
            the head of the intelligence wing of the former southeastern deep state organization. He is the current
            manager of the organization, which has become ineffective after its active work has ended and most of the
            executive staff has been exposed.His son was murdered by terrorists during the raid on his house. Thereupon
            he erased the state from his mind. He began to act autonomously by binding the confessors and guards under
            state protection to himself. İskender Büyük felt danger due to Ersoy Ulubey's unstable behavior and sent him
            to the mountains where various organizations were located, under the name of duty, to be killed. Ersoy
            Ulubey managed to survive every time. He got involved in drug and smuggled cigarette business with his
            intelligence officers. He formed an army of 1000 people, such as confessors and guards, brought from the
            Southeast and always under his command, and camped them in Istanbul. He appointed Hamit, a former organizer
            but later a confessor and working for intelligence, as the head of this army. Polat Alemdar raided this camp
            and destroyed part of the army. However, Ersoy Ulubey also caused great harm to Polat. He killed Memati's
            son and shot Polat's mother, then he was caught, beaten to death with an ax by Polat and Memati, and thrown
            down from the Police Department building.

            He is the baron of the Council of Wolves and the person at the top of the mafia. He is the greatest baron of
            the Greater Middle East. Chosen by the Supreme Chosen, Baron, who could see 10 moves ahead, was appointed to
            his post in 1983. His predecessor was excommunicated because of Iran. He is a very intelligent and
            aristocratic character.In his youth, he was an intelligence officer trained by Doğu Eşrefoğlu. He served in
            various positions on behalf of the Turkish Resistance Organization in Cyprus with his partner Aslan Akbey.
            The most important of these duties is to arm the Turkish Resistance Organization. He distributed weapons on
            the island in his role as an orange trader.Mehmet Karahanlı's only weakness is his son Efe Yakup Karahanlı,
            who was kidnapped when he was a child. His only failure in life is that he cannot find his son. He changed
            sides and betrayed the state due to his weakness for power during his second mission to destroy the secret
            forces, which was his second mission taken by Doğu Bey after the Cyprus Operation. Karakhanid, who sided
            with the mysterious forces, successfully passed various levels and became the Great Baron of the Greater
            Middle East. He established a great empire for his son Efe.Mehmet Karahanlı accepts Tombalacı Mehmet Çolak,
            whom he raised by marrying Esther Hirch, to his council. At first, international relations, political issues
            and balances were discussed in the council. Everyone on the council had been friends with everyone for at
            least 20 years. But then other things started to be talked about: Şevko's ambassadorship would share
            Süleyman Çakır's course with the council and make a decision about the situation of these two.The bingo
            player made his own decisions and raided Çakır's casino and killed many people. Thereupon, Baron Mehmet
            Karahanlı removed Tombalacı Mehmet from the Council. By the order of the Baron, Kılıç put Tombalacı on a
            boat to leave the country, but when he learned that Tombalacı was doing business with the Russians, he
            ordered Kılıç to inform Çakır about the location of Tombalacı's boat. Thus, Çakır caught Tombalacı and beat
            him to death with a baseball bat in the casino he had scanned.

            His real name is Abbas Ustaoğlu. His code name is Uncle. Polat Alemdar used to call him Chief in the first
            season. He is the head of an intelligence agency called the Public Security Organization (KGT). He is the
            grandson of Kuşçubaşı Eşref. He is a great patriot.He graduated from the Military Academy.[3] He is an
            intelligence officer trained by Doğu Eşrefoğlu in his youth. Together with his partner Mehmet Karahanlı, he
            served in many positions, especially in the Turkish Resistance Organization. Israel bombed these camps as a
            result of Karakhanid denouncing the Turkish intelligence officers in the camp in Palestine in order to
            declare his loyalty to the Masonic organization, which he betrayed and joined during his last mission.Among
            these camps are Aslan Akbey's brother and his brother's pregnant girlfriend. Unable to handle both his
            partner's betrayal and the murder of his brother and his brother's lover, he kidnapped Mehmet Karahanlı's
            son, Efe Yakup Karahanlı, and after years of training, he trained him as a patriot and made him an
            intelligence officer affiliated with the KGT unit. Efe Karahanlı, who was adopted by the Candan Family, grew
            up as a patriot. Efe, who did not know his real identity, knew himself as Ali Candan and after carrying out
            successful operations in various parts of the world on behalf of the KGT, secretly from his family, he was
            invited to the country by Akbey and his face was changed with a plastic surgery to fight against his own
            father Mehmet Karahanlı and his Council. was infiltrated into the mafia. This operation was called Operation
            Valley of the Wolves. Aslan Akbey gave Polat the task of gaining the trust of mafia boss Süleyman Çakır, who
            carried out the orders of the Council, and asked him to destroy the Council from within. Through Polat, he
            managed to sow discord within the Council and collapse it from within. By ensuring the failure of two
            schemes established by the council members on different dates for the purpose of arms and drug trade, he
            caused the disappearance of the figures close to the Karakhanid, first Tombalacı Mehmet and then Sawere
            Necmi.

            Even though Kılıç was under the protection of Sawe Necmi due to his hierarchy within the council, he had
            one-on-one meetings with Şevko and Süleyman Çakır, ended the hostilities between the two and personally
            announced the rewards and punishments. Since he was the most influential name after Karakhanid, he became
            someone whose word was respected, feared and respected both within the mafia and the council.It was revealed
            in a dream that Nergiz Karahanlı had that his real name was Ali. His surname was determined to be Yağızgil
            when Mehmet Karahanlı's will was read. Commonly known as The Sword. He is one of the members of the Council
            of Wolves. He is the right-hand man of Baron Mehmet Karahanlı. At one point, Karahanli asked Kılıç, Who
            knows me better than you, Kılıç? he asks. Kılıç smiling, my mother. he replies. Thereupon, Karakhanid also
            smiles and says, For God's sake, I fear your mother. he says. Based on this dialogue, it can be thought that
            Karahanlı may have been adopted by Kılıç's family and this is how this close friendship (Am I not your
            brother, Mehmet?) began. However, nothing concrete is said about this in the series.He ensures the security
            of the baron, his family and the council. He stands out with his impulsive personality. His characteristic
            feature is the pocket knife in his hand and the scar on his face. It was later understood that this pocket
            knife was the key to the cryptex and that the scar was made by the intelligence officer named Aslan Akbey,
            who kidnapped Polat Alemdar when he was a child. Kılıç asked Nergis Karahanlı and Nizamettin Güvenç whether
            Polat was Efe or not, Nergis Karahanlı remained unanswered because she was not sure whether Polat was his
            son, but Nizamettin Güvenç asked Polat Alemdar for his own interests in order to attract Kılıç to his side.
            Although Mehmet hid from him the fact that he was Karahanlı's son, after Polat saved Safiye from
            Nizamettin's hands, he realized that he was Safiye's brother and therefore Karahanlı's son and asked
            Nizamettin why he lied to him. Nizamettin You asked me what you wanted to hear, and I told you what you
            wanted to hear. he replied.

            He was born in 1954. His real name is Mazhar Yıldıran. He spent most of his life fighting against terrorism
            in the mountains, participated in many operations, and organized hundreds of operations with his own team.
            When he realized that his era was over, he made a deal with the state and became dead. It all starts with
            the breaking of this agreement. Kara is one of the people who knows the unconventional warfare style best in
            Turkey. For this reason, secret groups within and outside the state want to push them into the black field.
            Even though Kara doesn't want to go back, what happened pushes him back onto the field.

            Mr. Kara, who was injected with Ebola into her body by Key's man, said, "I would rather die with my own
            soldier's bullet than die with the enemy's filth." He got himself killed by Black Sancak members.

            Kara represents Mahmut Yıldırım, known by his nickname Yeşil. He gets his nickname from a color, Kara is
            also from Bingöl. Kara's name, like Yeşil, has been involved in unsolved murders. Similarities like these
            confirm that he represents Green. On the other hand, his death is similar to that of Yakub Cemil, one of the
            supporters of the Committee of Union and Progress.

            As his name suggests, he is a character of Zaza origin, so he is also known as Uncle Zaza. He is from
            Elazığ. He has a habit of constantly playing with the earlobes of the people around him, especially his
            closest man, Cevher. When he is dissatisfied or very happy, he asks the other person, "Don't you love me/Do
            you love me?" he says. His men often respond to him by saying, "I love you, uncle/Let those who do not love
            you die." While he was working for İskender Büyük, he was imprisoned for drug smuggling. However, after 25
            years, he was released from prison with the help of İskender. He is influential in the streets because of
            the many nephews he has under his command. He is aware of everything that happens on the streets of
            Istanbul. His work is based more on theft than the mafia style, usually on purse-snatching and sometimes on
            smuggling. His rise and his name becoming a big name is thanks to İskender Büyük. Even though he did not
            like İskender Büyük very much after he was released from prison, he stood by him out of duty of loyalty. In
            the later episodes of the series, as the Iskender formation gradually collapsed, he ordered Zaza to hand
            over his money and the children under his command to the organization. Zaza was forced to fulfill this
            request, but then he fulfilled his duty of loyalty and did not go to help Polat Alemdar, even though he was
            aware of it when he came to catch him. Since he did not go despite Alexander the Great's call and risked his
            life, he raided Zaza's place with a large number of Aron Feller's men wearing ski masks and killed all of
            his men. When Polat Alemdar and intelligence officers came from behind, he escaped by helicopter before he
            could kill Zaza. Having lost their men and nephews, the relations between Zaza and Polat Alemdar, which were
            previously damaged due to İskender Büyük, have entered a process of rapprochement. Memati also left his
            tense relations with Zaza and became closer over time, even acting as a referee in the issue between
            Zülfikar Ağa and Zaza.
